# Image-Classifier-API

This project is a simple Image Classifier API that allows users to upload images and receive predictions about the contents of the images using a pre-trained machine learning model. The backend is built with **Flask**, while the API is served using **Gunicorn**. The application is designed to be deployed using **Docker** and **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Python** – Core programming language
- **Flask** – Web framework for the API
- **Flask-CORS** – Handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- **Gunicorn** – WSGI server for running the Flask app in production

### Machine Learning & Computer Vision
- **TensorFlow** / **PyTorch** – Frameworks for building and training the image classification model
- **OpenCV** – Image processing and handling
- **NumPy** – Numerical computing and array operations
  
### Frontend
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – Static frontend for the API (if applicable)
- **Bootstrap** – Responsive design and styling
- **Fetch API** – Handles API requests to Flask backend (if applicable)

### Development & Tools
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and collaboration
- **VS Code** – Primary code editor
- **Postman** – API testing tool
